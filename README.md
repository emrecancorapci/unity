# Useful Unity Scripts

I publish post my cute little codes here. You can use them freely.
All I want is for you to write me thank you so that I can sleep at night with the joy of being useful.

## [Multiple Ojbect Pooling](multiple-object-pooling.cs)
With this code you can:
- pool your desired objects, ***YEAH!***
- choose amount to pool for every different object, ***WOW!***
- choose which object you want to take. ***AWSOME!***
